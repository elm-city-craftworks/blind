> IN AD 2101, WAR WAS BEGINNING.

> THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY RUBYISTS ARE LOST IN SPACE,
CAUGHT IN A TRAP BY THEIR EVIL ALIEN OVERLORDS, 
THE COBOLITES. THEIR SHIP HAS BEEN SHROUDED IN A CLOAK OF DARKNESS, AND THEY
ARE NOW STUCK INSIDE A DEADLY FIELD OF SPACE MINES.

> FORCED TO NAVIGATE BY EAR, THEY MUST AVOID BUMPING INTO THE
MANY BEEPING MINES WHILE SEARCHING FOR A SECRET WORMHOLE
PROVIDED TO THEM BY THEIR ALLIES, THE PYTHONISTA FEDERATION.

> THE PYTHONISTAS HAVE MARKED THE WORMHOLE WITH A SONIC CODE
THAT IS UNDETECTABLE TO THE COBOLITES, BUT WILL BE
IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZABLE TO ANY HUMAN AS THE SOUND OF A 
RINGING TELEPHONE.

> IN THEIR QUEST TO LOCATE THE HIDDEN WORMHOLE, THE RUBYISTS
MUST TAKE CARE NOT TO GO TOO FAR OUT INTO SPACE, FOR THE
MINEFIELD IS TRULY THE HIGHWAY TO THE DANGER ZONE, BEYOND
WHICH CERTAIN DOOM IS INEVITABLE.

> PLEASE HELP THE RUBYISTS ESCAPE FROM THEIR PENDING DOOM!
